# Preface Proof System

Preface proofs system front end application. I developed this for designers and production staff at Crown Trophy to send proofs directly to clients without the involvement of sales staff. Conversely, sales staff could check on the status of a proof without contacting the designers/production staff. The codebase has been sanitized and is not confidential or proprietary to Crown Trophy. I've received permission from ownership to do with it as I please, as it was mostly written at home during my free time.

Composer.lock was generated on deployment and is included here for illustrative purposes. Please note that the Composer autoload is mentioned in a few files. Again, this was generated on deployment and is not present here.

I'm not sure yet what my eventual goal with this project is. I'd like to refactor it (most likely with a modern framework, instead of vanilla PHP) and turn it into something or publish it as open-source. At a minimum, proper error logging and handling needs to be implemented. The market for a simple, small service like this for small businesses is virtually non-existent, so it'd be interesting to explore this as a side project.
